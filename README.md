## iOS Asset Updater

Iterate recursively over a folder matching each image file (.jpg, .png) with a corresponding asset in an iOS project folder.

Names have to match exactly for the update to take place, but the file extension can be different.

The file Contents.json is updated to reflect the changes.

### TODO

- Support .pdf files;
- Add examples;
